# k3s Homelab
This is the section of my homelab that is built on kubernetes. I have set up the majority of my homelab using docker and more specifically docker compose. I figured that I would start trying to use kubernetes to get a feel for it.
Therefore, this is my journey down the path of Kubernetes in my homelab.
